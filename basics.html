        <h1> Interneting is SO EASY!</h1>
        <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
<!--First look at headings-->
        <h2> Headings</h2>
        <p2>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p2> 
        <!-- Creating UNORDERED lists-->
        <h3>LISTS</h3>
        <p> This is how you make an unordered list</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Add a "ul" element (It stands for Unordered lists)</li>
            <li> Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li> They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Creating Ordered Lists-->
        <p> This is what an ordered lists looks like</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li> But, the list items elements are the same</li>
            <li> Also note how the number increment on their own</li>
            <li> You should be noticing things is the precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
        </ol>

        <!--Switching gears to EMPHASIS and text manipulation-->
        <h1> EMPHASIS</h1>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
        <p> This sentence shows the important of using <strong>Strong</strong> or bold</p>
        <p> And sometimes you need to <em><strong> shout!</strong></em> </p>
    
    
    <!--due to coding limits you may need to break a sentence-->

    <p> another example of breaking pages is like this... </p>

    <p> P.S. This page might look like crap, but that can be fixed using CSS soon.</p>
