WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE. This webpage has been specifically designed
to apply for a program by vetswhocode.com. 

This website will be displaying a lot of inofrmation about me, including what I have done
what I do and what I plan on doing. 

This capstone will hopefully let me acheive access to the program
and the ability to acheive multiple coding certificates. 

This ReadMe will also be used as a tracker for the progress
of the webpage. 

Please contact me if you have any questions at 5807543213 or jmkski92@gmail.com
