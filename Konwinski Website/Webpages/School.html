        <h1>Justin's Schooling!</h1>

        <p1>Hello! I graduated from Choctaw High School in Oklahoma in 2011. While in school, I took multiple computer courses that increased 
            my proficiency on the basic office 365 programs. 
            <br>
            <br>
           I then went to Oklahoma State University where I started as a Computer Science Major. I eventually switched my Major to Accounting and graduated in 2015. 
           Before graduation I took Computer Science 1 which was all about Java coding, and multiple business computer courses which focused on access and excel programs. 

            <br>
        </p1>
