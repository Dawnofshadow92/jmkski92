        <h1>Justin's Work History!</h1>

        <p1>In 2009, I started as a crew member at McDonalds in Chcotaw High School. I worked for a year before I was promoted to Crew Trainer. In 2012, I quit working at McDonalds due 
            to the distance between the location of the McDonalds and where I was going to College. 
            <br>
            <br>
           In 2012, I began working at a carmike theater for about a year. After working there for about a year I got a new job at the Oklahoma State University IT Helpdesk. 
           I was originally hired as a tech 1 responsible for answering the phones, replying to emails, and chatting with customers on solving any type of IT issues. 
           I was eventually promoted to a Tech 3 where I was responsible for designing the new Standard Operating Procedures for the Help Desk and training new Tech 1s on how to solve problems. 
            <br>
            In 2016, I began working as a police officer for Guymon, Oklahoma. I did this until I was offered the oppurtunity to go Active Duty Army. I have been active duty 
            since 2017 and am now transiting out of the military.
